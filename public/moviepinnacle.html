<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO PINNACLE</h1>
<br>
<h2>MY TOP THREE MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Good Doctor</h3>
<p>This movie has to be my top #1 because it delved into standard hospitals and surgeries</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime becauseit involves a lot of attributes and lessons that are applicable real time</p> 


<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>This is also my favorite because it's a law centred setting and a great movie to learn tricks</p>
